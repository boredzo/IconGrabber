this is a simple front-end to the Icon Services GetIconRef function. there is one floating window with an image well, a field, and a 'Draw' button. you enter a four-character OSType into the field and click Draw. the icon appears in the image well. if you enter an unknown type, you get the generic document icon; if you enter text that is not four characters long, the app beeps and the icon doesn't change.
